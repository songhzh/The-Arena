# The Arena
A 2D 2P Fighting Game. WIP, on-hold during studies!

Currently, the game only creates player 1, to make way for more game features. However, most of the framework is already set up to easily add player 2.

# Controls
* a / d : walk
* w : jump
* s : crouch
* c : punch
* v : kick

# Combos
Entering certain keys in a certain order will execute special moves, for example:
* s -> a : backstep
* d -> d -> d+c : ultimate (shoots projectile)
